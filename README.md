# Reddit Scraper

This is a fairly simple multi-threaded reddit comment scraper and parser written in Python.
I do not recommend using this code unmodified in any environment, particularly not production.

Roughtly based on MetaReddit and AutoModerator.

This is tested with Python 2.6.9.

You will need SQLAlchemy.
